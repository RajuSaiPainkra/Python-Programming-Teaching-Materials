# Foundational print snippet, used almost all Developers, Programmer

# print() function - Built-In Function

print("Hello, Python!") # this is Build-In function 

# What if, we have to build the code with the Built-in Library

import sys #import the sys library for printing the output

sys.stdout.write("Hello, Python!") # using sys library to print the output without newline


## something more that i have been forget to learn : :

# print is Keyword in python - a Reserved Keyword 
# print() now it is Built-In Function in Python  ## function = a block of Code that only runs when it is called
